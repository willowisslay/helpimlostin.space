	        <p>Well, I survived June! It's definitely been an eventful month, to say the least, for good things and bad things but fuck it we roll. I'll be very honest here when I say that I'm entering July with a very shitty start (I know very few people who have had a good June), which sucks. I'm still very hopeful that I can end July in a much better place. I have been doing a lot of thinking, crying, apologising and considering my places everywhere recently- there's good and bad things to all that, you know how it is with reflecting on stuff. I'm still very torn about some decisions that I need to make soon, stuff that I won't get into but still I hope to share in the near future. I still don't feel quite stable yet, but I'm becoming much more stable to do things and I feel like generally I'm doing better?</p>
	        <p>I've recently got myself a decent little routine with it being extremely warm over here in the UK, where I spend all day inside and wait until 6pm-ish and then go for walks in a local forest. It's really nice, just getting out and surrounding yourself in the middle of nowhere, without being bothered too much and without the sun killing me (I love summer, it's the best but still). I've also been finding myself staying up much later for no real reason, and I've also been moving my Discord stuff to the sammie.hearts account. I can't quite recall why anymore but I started so I'd better finish it.</p>
	        <p>I've been leaving so many places that kept me busy and that gave me somewhere to find comfort in. I have no real place like that at the moment, I don't feel ready to move on yet though. I don't want to move on, really and I don't know if the people around me want me to move on too. It's complicated I guess. I still have lots of time to think about things though. It hardly feels right to be typing and sharing this but if I keep that attitude I'll just end up isolating myself again.</p>
	        <p>Big thank you to the people who have been checking in on me and giving me bits of advice over the last few weeks, I appreciate every single one of you.</p>
	        <p>~ With lots of love, from Moon.</p>
