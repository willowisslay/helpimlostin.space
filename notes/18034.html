	        <p>Today's been hard. I got a reply. I thought I'd feel better. I don't. I don't know what I was expecting. I think I got what I had expected. I've still been crying. I still feel weird and it hasn't gone away. I left Hokoria, tried to leave Cycoldia but had to put that on hold. I left a bunch of other places. I'm abandoning my main Discord account soon. Will probably leave behind a bunch of other places too. The Orchard will probably be included. I felt so ready to leave everything and vanish earlier today. I'm glad I didn't. I still feel like shit and still don't feel comfortable sharing much besides this all with anyone, but at least I know I didn't completely fuck everything up. I think I can save it.</p>
	        <p>Still angry too with how everything went down. I shouldn't be. I am though. I don't want it to happen again.</p>
