	        <p>As soon as I get myself back on track to start doing things again something just drags me back down. I have been like, not perfectly fine but I've been functioning well for nearly a week, which has been great- it's meant that I could get lots of stuff done and all that. And then like at the time where I *need* to be focused and I need the energy and functioning to carry on with the projects that I began working on since Wednesday evening, BOOM it's gone haha fuck you. Am I not allowed to care anymore? Is it that I start caring and feeling emotions a bit better which is what fucks me up? Because it feels that way. The moment I wrap my head around things or begin trying to care or trying to put a label on the way that I feel is when everything starts going downhill again. I haven't even had a week where I felt okay. This shit is so so so extremely unfair because I want to feel fine but apparently no I'm not allowed to. And I really really do not understand it at all.</p>
            <p>Edit: Ignoring emotions and the way I feel about things is not healthy. I know that, I don't want to do that. But it is so fucking horrible to end up feeling this way like I'm getting STRIPPED of feeling certain things.</p>
