	        <p>I've felt like utter complete shit for the last few days, randomly crying and having a weird feeling in my chest that doesn't go away. I've lost all motivation to go out IRL and find myself struggling to speak to people. Everyone just tells me that it will be okay but nothing feels okay right now and I don't know what to do.</p>
