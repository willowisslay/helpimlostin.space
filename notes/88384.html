	        <p>Regarding my friend server, 'moon's torture chamber':</p>
			<p>I have every right to choose who does and does not get access to my friends server. It is literally just a silly place where I post things and chat with people, if you're not in there I promise you are not missing too much and it does not mean that "we are not friends". I've invited people in there based on how well they can get along with my other friends, whether or not it was appropriate to invite them or simply if I could be bothered. I have very close friends who <u>are not</u> in there, and I have people that I barely talk reguarly with that <u>are</u> in there. It's just my own little personal space for things, it's somewhere I want to keep drama and arguments out of and it's somewhere that I want to feel comfortable enough to post basically anything I want without needing to hold myself back or without worrying people will take it the wrong way.</p>
			<p>Thank you for your understanding!</p>
