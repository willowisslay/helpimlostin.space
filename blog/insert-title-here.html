                                <p>Ignore the title. I'm just going in here without knowing what exactly I want to write about. So I guess we do a little thought dumping or a stream of thoughts (I think it's called). It's a turbulent last few weeks, I'd say for sure. Nothing I haven't gone through before but it's left me feeling very tired and hanging on by a thread. There have been so many times when I've sat down and thought about disappearing off the face of the earth because drama and stress just followed me around everywhere I went and I couldn't get away from it and people thinking they know me well enough to decide what I want, don't want, can decide and can't decide. I got really pissed off over that, as I do everytime I get treat as someone less capable or less independent than I actually am. And when that's people close to you, and when it happens as much as it does for me, it's really disappointing. Nobody, not a single person has been safe from the internal discussions of "This person hates me" or "This person doesn't care" and it also left me feeling a little bit alone at times even though in reality I had a small group of people there to listen, share my anger and make me laugh a bit throughout it. These people know who they are.</p>
                                <p>I'm thinking about my next steps. In September I'm going to university and although at the moment it looks like I'm going to be staying put at home, I'm keeping my options open and have looked at some places to stay.</p>
                                <p>I think I lost myself a bit in the stress of everything that had been going on, and I think I felt a bit out of control. There wasn't much I could do. I think I'm doing ever so slightly better but I'm still exhausted, having thoughts of withdrawing from people a bit again so I can speed that up again. It's just finding a balance of social interaction and being involved in stuff, and I've never been good at managing that. It's usually better and easier to cut off entirely.</p>
                                <p>I have a random private Google Doc that I vent in and <i>goddayum</i> there has been <u>a lot</u> of stuff written in there. Not so much in the last few days, so maybe that's a good thing? I can't really tell. It's either that or it just means I've been internalising it. Lol.</p>
                                <p>And uhm I don't really know what to write, <i>buttttt</i> I do think that you should go and listen to <a href="https://tidal.com/browse/track/430715919">this song</a>. It's really good and if you don't, I will bite you. Anyway bye! (GO LEAVE A MESSAGE IN MY GUESTBOOK TOO OR YOU HATE ME)</p>
