                                <h2>Mr President! They hit the eleveth blog post!</h2>
                                <p>Nearly a month without a venty, ranty blog post is always a good thing! These things are always sort of a way for me to let out my thoughts and share stuff that's been going on in my life, and it's not that I haven't been doing anything- I have! I've been doing a shit ton of stuff. I think a week or two ago, I started working on re-making this site into a different theme. The current one is alright, I just think it's a bit boring. I have lots of ideas for what I want to make, nothing I'm ready to share just yet though!</p>
                                <p>Over the last week, I've been playing a LOT of an Earth SMP style server with a bunch of other people. My friend Sakura is the leader of Ireland, and I'm their second-in-command. It's genuinely been very very fun to play, cause chaos and really really annoy people.</p>

                                <p>I've found myself with lots of stuff to do, even if I still do get bored sometimes- big shoutout to the people in my friends server for being based. Speaking of my friends, my friend Sera reminded me of this thing I did back in 2022/23 called the 'JunoBOT lore'. Only the real ones will know what I'm talking about here, but it was basically just me messing around in a creator that I used to admin for's server and doing lore stuff. The community loved it (I think??) and genuinely even if it was flawed and I didn't really have any real direction for what I wanted to do with it, I really enjoyed it too. I am considering getting back into something like that again because goddamn was it peak. And maybe the next thing can be better, who knows.</p>
                                <p>I have no idea if I'll keep this up, but I'm going to start recommending media every blog post! Here's some that I've been enjoying recently:</p>
