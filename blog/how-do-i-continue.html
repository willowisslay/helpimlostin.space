                                <p>a vent and a cry for help</p>
                                <p>Currently just sat on my bed. I feel so, so exhausted I can't describe it. But I'm so restless and my mind feels so... loud with silence I can't describe it. I feel like I can't hear my own thoughts like I usually can. I can't concentrate or think like I usually can. I feel like my thoughts are being stripped away from me when I think them and somehow writing helps get past that. I'm really upset, anxious and just. Losing my will to live. On the inside at least. I need to cry and nothing is happening. I wish I could scream but I don't have the energy. My college work is due in just over 30 hours, the same college work that I got an extention for on Monday and proceeded to not do anything. I haven't been the best, all week. I don't know who I am. Everything is too much. I can't get any help for it. Unless I tried to kill myself. That would get me help. I don't want to. I shouldn't have to. I hope I don't. Not today at least. I just need help. But I have nobody. Why are things like this? Why am I allowed to feel this way? I just want to go and never have to go through this again. But I know this isn't the end of any of this. What am I supposed to do? Why can't someone be there to catch my fall, or at the very least break it? This sucks. but at least I feel slightly better writing this. A little bit. Doesn't change anything though. I'll just be back here tommorrow night feeling this exact way, or worse. Probably worse. Do I deserve this?</p>
                                <p>I'm really sorry everyone.</p>
