                                <h2>Getting kicked out in July</h2>
                                <p>Well, I definitely haven’t been keeping up with this blog- but damn do I have some hot juicy tea for you all.</p>
    							<p>I’ve recently made the decision that I’ll be leaving home in September in order to live in University student halls. My family have been aware of this for a while, and I’ve always been told that whatever I choose, I will be supported.</p>
    							<p>Now, some context is that I’m technically, but not legally, a child in care. I live with my Grandma under a court order which is somewhat financially supported by my local government. When I turn 18 later this month, the court order ends. However the local government has said that they will keep supporting that until July, when I finish college.</p>
    							<p>Yesterday, I told my Grandma about the decision I’ve made to stay in Uni halls and it was not taken well. For months she has been telling me that I’m incapable of living independently and that if I choose to leave in September, I won’t be allowed back.</p>
    							<p>I have been fine with that arrangement, and the chance that my disability money could end in September when I move to Uni. Equally, I have been told that there is a chance that I can keep receiving thet money. It’s a significant amount of money, but I have been sick and tired of living in an unaccepting household. Staying at home wouldn’t help my mental health or my studies, and I’ve been more and more sure about staying at Uni halls with every single time she tells me (and other people that) I’m incapable.</p>
    							<p>I was instead told that I would be getting kicked out in July when she stops getting money from the local government to look after me. That was quite the bombshell, considering I wouldn’t be able to move to or afford to move to Uni halls until September. I was then later told that she would be going out of her way to cancel the disability money that I recieve, because she thinks that I would lose it anyway and that she ‘doesn’t want to be responsible for it’.</p>
    							<p>Keep in mind that the disability money would have been enough to support me in carrying on living with her until September, and even after if I would be allowed to keep it.</p>
    							<p>So, I’m being kicked out for wanting to stay in Uni. Not really because she can’t financially responsible for me but more because she sees this as a massive “fuck you” to her instead of the opportunity to live independently to me.</p>
    							<p>I have nowhere I can really go, my Parents live separate. My Mother isn’t well and doesn’t live in the safest environment and my Father, though he lives in a safe and stable environment, living with him is out of the picture.</p>
    							<p>I’m figuring out my options with my local government, but nothing is promised. They have a certain responsibility for me, but again- nothing is promised.</p>
    							<p>My sister has been absolutely amazing and is supporting me, and we’re looking at cutting my Grandma’s access to my disability benefit. I think for now I’ll be fine, but the fact that nothing is set in stone and that I have no housing security between July and September, I’m very stressed out by it all.</p>
