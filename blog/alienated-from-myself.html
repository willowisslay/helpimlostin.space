                                <h2>Alienated from myself</h2>
                                <p>I recently have been doing a bunch of stuff- completing my final college project (augh), doing lots of Hokoria project work and so on. It's all been keeping me very busy, but for the last bit of time I've been struggling a bit. Maybe that 'something I wrote for a college project' (see the blog post below) <i>wasn't</i> just a fictional story and was more of a vent, but I feel mostly better mentally now.</p>
                                <p>I'm glad to have found people who I get along with really well, people that I care about and people that I trust like crazy (love you, planet members). They've really been a massive rock to me, they're people that I'm so so so so grateful for. I can't express that enough.</p>
                                <p>And recently I've been trying some stuff, working to make myself a little more confortable? I'm using the name Willow less and am using 'Moon' instead. I can't remember where that one came from (my friend Sakura maybe?) but it's a very comfy name that doesn't alienate me in the same way as Willow began to. It didn't always feel right being called Willow, and although it was less of an issue at the start, it sometimes felt a bit less me and more like somebody else.</p>
                                <p>Which was difficult and caused way too many issues that could have easily been avoided, but whatever. IRL I still go by Willow in most places, not sure if that will change though. I still need to have a big think about that one.</p>
