                                <h2>Shattering</h2>
                                <p>I thought I was doing okay overall, even if mentally I've been terrible for months. Even though I was not in the best place, I think I was somewhat healing from everything that has torn me apart earlier on in the year and the stuff that was still hurting me from last year. I don't really know what exactly happened on Sunday but it turned into what has without a doubt been one of the most painful weeks I've had to live through in a long long time. I've messed things up so badly with people in the last two weeks, a few people- people that I care about a lot. And it just reminds me how this isn't the first time I've done something like this? I went looking for a Tweet, a vent, anything about being scared about hurting people. I know I posted something. It was deleted, but oh my god I never want to go through anything like this ever again. I've felt so lost, so cut off by myself and weird feeling in my chest that hasn't gone away since the week started. My apetite and motivation are just... Not even there most of the time. My only comfort has been the odd chat with people and today has been bearable because of joining VCs and making sure I had people to talk with. I don't trust myself alone with my thoughts anymore, it has only ever ended in ruining things. I have felt a bit better today, still not doing well at all. I so badly need to go back to how things were, it's not possible anymore and I'm definitely handling that really badly. Even where I do keep myself distracted, part of me feels that I'm only running away from everything and pretending things are okay and never happened. I'm just. This week has sucked and I don't think I can through anything like this ever again.</p>
                                <p>Friends who have known me a while know that I can be a bit self-destructive and even though everything that's happened here has been the same, or very similar to everything before, it's completely different in the way that the people around me cared enough to worry. And I didn't realise it. I feel like I'm shattering into little pieces of glass.</p>
