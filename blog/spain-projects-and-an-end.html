                                <p>Hi! Hello! Hai! Hewwo! *fucking dies*</p>
                                <p>I'm back! I feel like it's been so long since I made a blog post and then I checked and it wasn't even a month ago since I did my last one. Oh well!!! Here I am, I got back from Spain a few days ago it was very nice. Here's a photo I took!</p>
                                <img width="50%" src="https://file.garden/aAP11hm2KRQR_ert/other/benidorm.jpg" alt="The sunset in a Spanish city">
                                <p>Sometimes it's just nice to leave my shitty country and go somewhere where things are nice. Even if the city I went to has lots of problems and is a bit of a shithole in some areas, still far better than being at home.</p>
                                <p>I've also been working on lots of <a href="https://weare.hokoria.net">Hokoria</a> stuff! We're holding an election so I've been super duper busy with getting things ready for that. It's looking like it's gonna be a big one, I'm looking forward to it.</p>
                                <p>And yeah. I don't know what else to say really, I did kind of write the title before writing so it just feels like I'm crossing off a checklist of stuff to write about lol.</p>
                                <p>I recently gave myself some closure in a thing that's been going on with someone else for a month or two now. I've felt fine about it for a while, now feeling even better about it- whatever that means. I found it really difficult to navigate and figure things out. It was hard for me at least, a lot of tears and not feeling okay that a few of my close friends will know made things tough for me. Closure is good too, I think I gave myself that. I'm much more content with where I'm at with it all.</p>
                                <p>Not gonna lie I'm tired and don't know what else to write... Uhm...</p>
                                <p>For the things I recommend I have no clue! Listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0s4Ma1D3irgqrQCRBUhc73">my dead girlfriend</a>, they make really good music.</p>
                                <p>Anyway bye!!</p>
