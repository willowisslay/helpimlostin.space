                                <h2>Finding acceptance</h2>
    							<p><em><u>The wording in this blog post may be shotty, I apologise if this is the case!</u></em></p>
    							<p>I’ve had a very busy last few weeks- dealing with plenty of online drama and completing my final and most important college project. And with all of that, I’ve found that I’ve been thinking a lot about my mental health and have been slowly been rediscovering myself.</p>
    							<p>But I’d been here before, actually a few years ago. In this exact same place, but discovering myself for the first time. I made decent progress- nothing magical, but enough to feel some sort of understanding and validity. Things sort of made sense, even if I wasn’t coping any better.</p>
    							<p>I’d discovered that I very well fit the picture of a dissociative disorder, found communities that I fit in with and could learn about from- learn about different ways that others cope. Even if I fit in, without any kind of professional diagnosis I felt somewhat invalid.</p>
    							<p>I tried getting some professional support- went through the process of speaking to a therapist about stuff and got referred to see someone about it, but for some reason I was never able to express it. It was quite scary. I tried getting to the same place multiple times but I had (and continue to) run into that same barrier.</p>
    							<p>Invalidation built up. I get quite depressed and I did end up publicly accusing myself of faking. I think I believed that for about a week and later had major regrets. I still don’t understand why I did that or why I have done similar things.</p>
    							<p>I did find acceptance later again, somewhere I felt comfortable to be more open. I admittedly have had moments of doubting whether any of this is real, and although I dislike labelling myself with a condition that I’m not diagnosed with, do feel more comfortable again to be even more open about things.</p>
    							<p>I do hope to seek a professional diagnosis, but I’m very hesitant to do that at the moment because of various things including the stuff I’ve already mentioned. I don’t think I fully accept myself, which as stupid as it sounds is a massive barrier.</p>
    							<p>This blog post, for me at least, is a part of that process. A very limited few people know everything that I’ve written here, and now this is open to IRL friends, my online friends, people in communities I’m a part of, my classmates, my college teachers and the list goes on.</p>
    							<p>I’m writing and publishing this to help myself a little, and may share a bit more in the future.</p>
    							<p>Willow out.</p>
